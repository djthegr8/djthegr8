Go to [my website](https://djthegr8.github.io) for a TFjS Face Recognition Demo    
     
I have a few blogs [on Medium](https://dj-ai.medium.com/), mostly regarding Artificial Intelligence, and a few tutorials on my own blog.   
My AI specialization is in Computer Vision and am learning about GANs, although I do a bit of NLP and Structured Data too.    
     
Reach me at [my mail](mailto:dweepjoshipuracar@gmail.com) for any collaborations!
